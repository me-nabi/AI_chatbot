# AI_chatbot
This is a simple Python chatbot built using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library. The chatbot is rule-based and can respond to basic user queries such as greetings, asking for help, and saying goodbye. This project demonstrates how to use patterns and reflections to create a simple conversational interface.

Provides simple responses to questions such as "What is your name?" and "How are you?".
Can handle requests for help by reflecting part of the user's input.
